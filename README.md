# ReactJS Animations
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


This repo is mainly for playing around with animations using ReactJS. <br />
These are not standalone projects. <br />
Each animation is created inside its own react app, so I can experiment with the animation on its own.
